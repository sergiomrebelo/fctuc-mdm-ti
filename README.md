# Interface Technologies 



The Interface Technologies course focuses on planning and designing interactions with human beings. Students should
acquire critical autonomy in evaluating and designing advanced interaction processes and be able to propose consistent
solutions, using a diverse range of technologies in the implementation of interactive solutions, including both software
and hardware parts. At the end of the course, students should be able to face the design of interfaces for specific
contexts, ensuring not only the aesthetic quality but also the usability and robustness of the implementation of their
proposals, resulting from the adequacy of their solutions to the needs of different projects.

The Interface Technologies course is part of M.Sc. [Design and Multimedia](https://dm.dei.uc.pt/) of University of Coimbra (Portugal)
